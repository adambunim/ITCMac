This is a mac app because my computer is too old to run on current phones or run a simulator.
But the app will run on ios with minimal changes.
it fetches a list of places from a server at localHost:3000
each place has title, description, and optionally location as lat/long.
you can add,delete,edit
you can filter by a string
you can filter only the places that are near tel aviv
